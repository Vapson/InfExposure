# Global transportation infrastructure exposure to the change of precipitation in a warmer world
This repository provides the code to perform a global transport asset exposure analysis for extreme precipitation under climate change.

## Data requirements
All transport data is based on OpenStreetMap (OSM). The planet file used in K. Liu et al. (2023) is downloaded at May 6, 2021.
Original Precipitation data are obtained from NEX-GDDP dataset, which is available at https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp.
All base data to run the code or results data runned by the code are available at Zenodo.
